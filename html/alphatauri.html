            Established in 2006 as a squad in which young drivers from Red Bull’s prodigious talent pool could cut their F1 teeth, AlphaTauri – originally named Toro Rosso – were formed from the ashes of the plucky Minardi team. Sebastian Vettel gave validity to the approach almost immediately, delivering a fairy-tale win in 2008, before going on to enjoy world championship success with parent team Red Bull Racing. Today the ethos of nurturing talent still holds true, though the Italian squad are no longer simply a ‘B team’ but a constructor in their own right...

        <p>
            Momentum stalls and lose ground to the likes of Alfa Romeo and Haas, dropping to P9 in the final standings, with just 35 points to 2021’s tally of 142. Pierre Gasly takes season’s best result with a fifth place in Baku, but departs the squad at the end of the year.

        <h2>2021</h2>
        <p>
            A new name brings new impetus and AlphaTauri emerge as a true midfield force, scoring more than a century of points, 27 of them on home soil at Monza, where Pierre Gasly secures his and the team’s maiden win.

        <h2>2019</h2>
        <p>
            In their final season under the Toro Rosso name, enjoy their most successful campaign to date, scoring 85 points and securing sixth in the standings. Mid-season driver swap sees Pierre Gasly return from Red Bull Racing, the Frenchman responding to his ‘demotion’ with a spectacular maiden podium in Brazil.
