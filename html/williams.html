        <p>
            Driven on by the brilliance and passion of the late Sir Frank Williams, Williams grew from humble beginnings to become a Formula 1 behemoth, unrivalled by all except Ferrari and McLaren in terms of enduring success. Over the past four decades the team has racked up Grand Prix wins and championship glory, and in the process nurtured some of the greatest talents in the sport, both in and out the cockpit. And, following the Williams family's decision to step aside after the 2020 sale of the team to Dorilton Capital, a new era has begun...

        <h2>2022</h2>
        <p>
            Despite the FW44 showing promising pace at times – particularly in the hands of Alex Albon, who qualifies an outstanding ninth at Spa – score just eight points across the season, leaving the team 10th and last in the final standings.
        </p>
        
        <h2>2021</h2>
        <p>
            Experience something of a resurgence, scoring a podium in rain-curtailed Belgian Grand Prix courtesy of regular Q3 qualifying star George Russell. Improve to eighth overall in a campaign sadly marred by the death of founder Sir Frank Williams in November.
        </p>
        
        <h2>2020</h2>
        <p>
            End a season without a point for the first time in their history, but the team's future is assured as new owners take over from the Williams family, and closer technical ties to engine suppliers Mercedes are agreed for 2021 and beyond.
        </p>
        <h2>2019</h2>
        <p>
            A single point from 21 races heralds the worst campaign in the team’s history, despite the addition of former Grand Prix winner Robert Kubica. On the flip side, rookie George Russell marks himself out as a star of the future, out-qualifying his experienced team mate at every round.
