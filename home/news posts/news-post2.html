                    Just over a month after parting ways with Team Principal Jost Capito, Williams announced they had signed Mercedes’ Motorsport Strategy Director James Vowles to fill that post. F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto looks at how and why the deal came about…

                    Williams are F1’s second most successful team in terms of constructors’ championships won, but have struggled to replicate that form and compete at the front since the turn of the century. They have finished last three times in the last four years.

                <p class="pt-4 pb-4 mb-4">
                    Owners Dorilton Capital decided late last year that things needed to change, and thus parted ways with Capito – while removing FX Demaison from his role as Technical Director. At the time, they didn’t have a replacement ready to go, with sources suggesting there were more than 10 under consideration.

                    Vowles makes the move to Grove-based Williams for 2023 after 21 years in Brackley

                  Vowles was high on their list – and Dorilton moved swiftly, getting the deal over the line in a month or so. Vowles says he told Mercedes boss Toto Wolff of the offer “a few weeks ago, into the New Year” and said the Austrian, as he expected, was “incredibly good” about the news.

              </p>
                <p>
                    That Vowles has been cleared to start work in just a few weeks (February 20) without the need of chunky garden leave suggests not only do Wolff and Vowles have a very close relationship – the strategist having become a close confidant and part of Wolff’s inner circle – but also that the association Mercedes have with Williams through their technical partnership is tight too. Though Capito had experience in F1, his stint with Sauber was almost 20 years ago, while he was at McLaren for just a few months. His pedigree came from rallying, through immense success with Volkswagen.

                    And while he did make changes to Williams that moved departments away from working in silos, it became clear to the owners that it will take at least five years, if not a decade to get back to the front – and stay there. At 64, Capito wasn’t the person to do that, Williams having already coaxed him out of retirement to do the job.
