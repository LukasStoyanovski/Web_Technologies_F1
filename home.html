    <p>Kevin Magnussen has been praised by Haas team boss Guenther Steiner for taking a more mature and relaxed approach to his F1 return, and some mid-season struggles, over the course of the 2022 campaign.

        Magnussen previously raced for Haas from 2017 to 2020 but was dropped – along with then-team mate Romain Grosjean – for 2021, with Haas bringing in rookie pairing Mick Schumacher and Nikita Mazepin.

        However, when Haas parted ways with Mazepin in the build-up to the 2022 season, they called on Magnussen to replace him, the Dane marking his shock return with a sensational P5 finish in the Bahrain opener.
        
        Further top 10 finishes followed in Saudi Arabia, Imola, Britain and Austria, before a more challenging seven-race spell outside the points – a run eventually broken with P9 in Japan and a stunning late-season pole position amid wet/dry conditions in Brazil.</p>
