    <p>orem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

    <p>Ferrari have become the second team to announce the launch date for their 2023 Formula 1 car.

        Last week Aston Martin became the first F1 squad to confirm when the covers would be coming off their new car, and now Ferrari have revealed their 2023 challenger will be unveiled to the world on February 14.
        
        The car currently goes by project number 675 but has no official name yet.

        Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz will continue as team mates at Ferrari for the third consecutive season, but it's all change at the top, after the Scuderia recently appointed ex-Sauber head Frederic Vasseur as Team Principal.
        
        The former Renault boss replaces Mattia Binotto, with Ferrari having finished second in the 2022 Formula 1 constructors’ championship.</p>
    
    <p>Ferrari's new Team Principal Vasseur said he was "delighted and honoured" to take on the job.

        "As someone who has always held a lifelong passion for motorsport, Ferrari has always represented the very pinnacle of the racing world to me," he said.

        "I look forward to working with the talented and truly passionate team in Maranello to honour the history and heritage of the Scuderia and deliver for our Tifosi around the world."
        
        The Scuderia last won the constructors' championship in 2008 and have since finished runners up six times.</p>
